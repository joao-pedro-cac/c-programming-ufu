## Easy problems

- `inside.c`: Given a text and a shorter string, highlights the first occurrence of the string in the text. Prints a special message in case of absence.
- `mediaimpares.c`: Creates an array of _N_ odd numbers starting at *s*, then outputs the overall arithmetic mean and the second last element.
- `malabarista.c`: Creates a [juggler sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggler_sequence) of _N_ numbers starting at _base_ and displays the general average as well as the smallest and largest elements.
- `somavetores.c`: Defines a sequence of the first _N_ positive odd numbers and another one with the first _M_ divisors of 4, starting at 0. After that, sums both sequences in case *N = M* or writes an error message otherwise.


## Medium problems

- `raizes2grau.c`: Solutions of the quadratic equation *axÂ² + bx + c = 0*.
- `aleatorios.c`: Produces a sequence of _N_ pseudorandom numbers ranging from _0_ to _N - 1_ using _N_ as a seed. At the end, prints the overall average and the smallest and largest numbers.


## Hard problems

- `golomb.c`: Analysis of [Golomb sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_sequence). Given _a_ and _b_, the algorithm takes a subsequence ranging from the *a*th to the *b*th element, then prints the first and last elements as well as the overall arithmetic mean of such subsequence. The Golomb sequence was adapted so that the *0*th element is *1*.
